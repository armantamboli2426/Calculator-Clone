# Calculator-Clone
A calculator clone serves as a digital replica of a traditional calculator, offering users a familiar interface for basic mathematical operations. With functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division readily available, users can efficiently perform everyday calculations. 
These devices often feature memory storage capabilities, enabling users to store and recall numbers for more complex calculations or multiple-step processes.

The design and layout of a calculator clone closely resemble that of a standard handheld calculator, providing users with a recognizable and intuitive user experience. Typically, these clones consist of a keypad for inputting numbers and operators, along with a display screen that showcases calculation results in real-time. This familiar layout makes it easy for individuals accustomed to using physical calculators to transition to a digital format seamlessly.
